delete window triggers delete tabs
create tabs comes back to you
document that badges are per tab AND PER URL

EXTENSIONS TEAM
onTabRemoved should include the oldWindowId
chrome.windows.get should include the populate parameter
chrome.windows.create should support a tab array
right click in popup should allow to inspect
css should not be cached while in developer mode
support debug mode (example: CSS buster)
support unicode or html characters in browserAction badges
better handling of mistakes in manifest, moving local dev folder
badge should have a per-window option
window.create should take same parameters as tab.create (in particular, pinned does not work)
isWindowClosing still does not distinguish last tab vs. window close
