Simple Window Saver makes it super easy to save and restore windows. Keep one window for work tabs, one for Gmail and Facebook, and one for your vacation planning or the research on that new TV you want to buy.

As the title reveals, simplicity is the name of the game. Unlike other session managers, Simple Window Saver remembers when you've saved a window and keeps track of changes. It's not full of features you don't need â€“ it does what you want and it does it well.

Go ahead, give it a try!

- - Data collection - -
Simple Window Saver uses Google Analytics to collect anonymous usage data, such as how many saved windows users have and how often a new window is saved. This helps me improve the extension.

I DO NOT and WILL NEVER track the urls or titles of the windows/tabs you save, or the names of the saved windows. If you have any concerns about this, you are welcome to inspect the source code (github link below, or use Chrome's web inspector).
